# Prompt:
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made 
# from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# The largest product will have a range between 5 to 6 digits.  Iterate through
# all 3-digit numbers from 100 to 999.  Python is exclusive of the last number
# in a range function, so we will enter 1000 and it will only call up to 999.

    # numbers and the second and second to last numbers and see if they are 
    # equal.  The middle number does not need to be compared. If the numbers
    # are equal, store the product in largest_palindrome the two factors into 
    # i_saved and j_saved, respectively.
